            <h2>History of the Mass</h2>
            <p>The mass find its historical roots in the Last Supper, where before the crucifixion, Jesus broke bread and blessed wine to symbolise his body and blood, and told the disciples to do thi
                s act in His memory.(<em>Matt 26:26-30</em>) </p>
            <br/>
            <p>This single act became the basis and foundation of all rites to be added on to the Mass. As per Jesus' instructions, the early believers used to meet and break bread in rememberance of our Lord, Jesus Christ. The early christians faced heavy persecusion and hundreds were matryred by the Roman rulers of their time. They were however able to meet every Sunday before daybreak to sing hymns to Christ, and later in the evening to eat together. They did this at the house of one of their members, whose dining room was large enough</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The Catholic liturgy of the Mass continued to evolve, as these meetings continued throughout the centuries and over many generations, but still remained rooted to the same Passover ritual. Consequently, a set order of conducting the Mass was introduced.  </p>

            <h3>Why Should I go for confession?</h3>
                   <p>The sacrament of reconciliation, is grounded both in Scripture and in early christian tradition. The Priestly authority to represent God as an ambassador of His Mercy was granted to St Peter by Jesus and the other apostles, and to the Priests, </p>

            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-4 team">
                <br/><br/>
                <p>who succeed them and are ordained to this day; Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven (<em>regarding to penance and granting absolution for sins</em>)  Matthew 16:19,18:18. Also "Whose sins you forgive, are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained"-John 20:23</p> <br/>
               
                 <p>Confession, like any other sacrament, is an outward sign of inward grace, therefore we are called to participate in all sacraments and church works with faith and conviction. For us to receive the blessing and the graces obtained from these, we need to firmly believe.</p>
                <p>All priests are sworn to treat all confessions as private and confidential. For many catholics, we tend to think that the Priest will judge or condemn us for our sins, especially if within the same parish. This is wrong. </p>
                <p>The sacrament of reconciliation is meant to reconcile us, to our Father in heaven, through the authority of the Church, given to her by Jesus Christ Himself, and is affirmed by the Holy Spirit</p>

                                   <dd>4. Confess all our sins. Bearing in mind that the wilfull undisclosure of any sin, is a sin in itself</dd>
                                   <dd>5. Do the penance as instructed by the Priest</dd>
                                   <dd>6. We firmly resolve to avoid sin and occassions of sin</dd>

            </div>
            
               
                <p>Please always remember, that Jesus loves you. There is no sin on earth that cannot be forgiven. There is nothing that can hide or separate us from the love of Christ. The only unpardonable sin (The sin against the Holy Spirit) is to lose all hope, faith, trust and confidence in the Holy Spirit, and therefore severe completely the link between us and our heavenly Father</p>
            <p>Remember also, that whatever distance we have to cover, whatever ocean we have to swim, whatever mile we have to run to get to the Father, Jesus has covered, swam and ran far much more, in order to get closer to us. Jesus is not shaken by our sinfulness, for where we are unfaithful, He has always remained faithful</p>
                <h3><em>But, there's always time to confess later...</em></h3>
                <p>God will always be there to forgive, to heal, to mend, to put together, to nurse. The question is, how much more willing are we to able bear the burden of sin, the guilt and the shame. How much of our peace are we willing to sacrifice, and substitute with the emptiness of eternal separation from the Prince of Peace? </p>
                    <p>Every moment of our lives, is a chance to improve, to be a better father, a loving mother, a more obedient child. Let us not therefore postpone the chance to be better christians, by procrastinating Confession </p>

                        <p style="line-height: 15px"; align="justify" > Zachariah, desiring a child, went to pray in the temple and was told by the angel Gabriel, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born." (Luke 1:13-15).</p>
                           

<p style="line-height: 20px"; align="justify" >Zachariah was skeptical because both himself and his wife were elderly. For his skepticism, Zachariah was rendered mute until the prophecy had been fulfilled.</p>

            <h3> ST. FRANCIS</h3>
                        <P style="line-height: 23px"; align="justify"  >Founder of the Franciscan Order, Francis' brotherhood included all of God's creation. Much has been written about Francis' love of nature but his relationship was deeper than that. We call someone a lover of nature if they spend their free time in the woods or admire its beauty.</P>
                        <p style="line-height: 21px"; align="justify" >  In one famous story, Francis preached to hundreds of birds about being thankful to God for their wonderful clothes, for their independence, and for God's care. The story tells us the birds stood still as he walked among him, only flying off when he said they could leave.</p>

Twelve was a very important number to the Chosen People: twelve was the number of the twelve tribes of Israel. If the new Israel was to come from the disciples of Jesus, a twelfth apostle was needed.</P>
                        <p style="line-height: 16px"; align="justify" >The new apostle was to be someone who had been a disciple from the very beginning, from his baptism by John until the Ascension.Two men fit this description -- Matthias and Joseph called Barsabbas.
